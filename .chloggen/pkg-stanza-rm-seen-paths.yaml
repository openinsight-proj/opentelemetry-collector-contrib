  Previously, every unique file path which was found by the receiver would be remembered indefinitely.
  This list was kept independently of the uniqueness / checkpointing mechanism (which does not rely on the file path).
  The purpose of this list was to allow us to emit a lot whenever a path was seen for the first time.
  This removes the separate list and relies instead on the same mechanism as checkpointing. Now, a similar log is emitted
  any time a file is found which is not currently checkpointed. Because the checkpointing mechanism does not maintain history
  indefintiely, it is now possible that a log will be emitted for the same file path. This will happen when no file exists at
  the path for a period of time.
