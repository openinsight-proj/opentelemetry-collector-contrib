  The fix updates the way to calculate the metrics to be consistent with `MEM USAGE`` and `MEM %`
  showed by the `stats` docker CLI command. It also support v1 and v2 of cgroups.
  Expect to see an increase of these metrics if currently running the receiver in a cgroups v1 environment.
  As well as see a decrease in these values if running on cgroups v2 environment.
