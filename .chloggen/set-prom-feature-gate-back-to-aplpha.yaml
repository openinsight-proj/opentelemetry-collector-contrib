  The feature gate `pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` was enabled prematurely while translation
  on the prometheus receiver was incomplete. To address this, the feature gate has been reverted back to alpha status.
  This will remain the case until the translation on the receiver side aligns with the translation on the exporter side,
  or until it is replaced with a configuration option or completely removed. To maintain the current behavior, you can
  enable the feature gate using the `--feature-gates=pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` command argument. 
  However, please note that the translation in the prometheus receiver is a subject to future changes.
