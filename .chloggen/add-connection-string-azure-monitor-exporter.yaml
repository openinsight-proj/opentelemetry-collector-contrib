  This enhancement simplifies the configuration process and aligns the exporter with Azure Monitor's recommended practices.
  The Connection String method allows the inclusion of various fields such as the InstrumentationKey and IngestionEndpoint
  within a single string, facilitating an easier and more integrated setup.
  While the traditional InstrumentationKey method remains supported for backward compatibility, it will be phased out.
  Users are encouraged to adopt the Connection String approach to ensure future compatibility and to leverage the broader
  configuration options it enables.
