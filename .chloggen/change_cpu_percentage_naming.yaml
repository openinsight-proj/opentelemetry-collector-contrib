  This starts the process of phasing out incorrect metric name:
  - `container.cpu.utilization`
  and replacing it with the names adhering to the semantic conventions:
  - `container.cpu.percent`
  At this stage, the new metric is added, but is disabled by default.
  See the "Deprecations" section of the Docker Stats receiver's README for details.
