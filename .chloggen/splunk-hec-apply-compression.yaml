  The compression used to be enabled only if the payload size was greater than 1.5KB which significantly
  complicated the logic and made it hard to test. This change makes the compression unconditionally applied to 
  the payload if it's enabled in the config. The benchmarking shows improvements in the throughput and CPU usage for 
  large payloads and expected degradation for small payloads which is acceptable given that it's not a common case.
